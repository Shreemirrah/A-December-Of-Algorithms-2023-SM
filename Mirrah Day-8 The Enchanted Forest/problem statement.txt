Problem Statement
In the mystical land of Pyborg, there lies an enchanted forest guarded by a magical creature. Legend has it that the only way to navigate through the forest is by creating a magical square.The creature is kind but loves patterns, and the magic square must follow a unique rule.

The rule is as follows: 1.The numbers in the square must form an increasing sequence starting from 1. 2.The sum of the numbers in each row, column and both main diagonals must be the same.

Write a function ‘find_path(n)’ that takes an odd integer ‘n’ as input and returns a 2D list representing the magic square required to safely traverse the enchanted forest.

Constraints: The input ‘n’ is an odd integer (3<=n<=15)

Help the brave adventurers in Pyborg to safely navigate the enchanted forest.



Sample Input/Output
Input: 3
Output: 
 2 7 6
 9 5 1
 4 3 8



Explanation

It is a 3x3 matrix where (2+7+6 = 2+9+4=15 ) and similarly all rows, diagonals and columns give the same sum as 15
